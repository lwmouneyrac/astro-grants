	<h2>Western Australia people can give you support</h2>
	<p class="paragraph">
		All our players are giving to grant by sharing a large portion of a
		ticket with WA organisations. You are an eligible organisation if
		youâ€™re: - a not-for-profit organisation (i.e. none of the profits go to
		owners or shareholders); or - a local government authority. Smaller
		not-for-profits may prefer to be auspiced by an eligible organisation.
		Contact us for more information if you are considering this approach,
		noting that your application must be accompanied by a signed Auspicing
		agreement. A template agreement is available here. Your organisation
		also needs to: - be an Australian entity and operating within Western
		Australia - not be operating on behalf of the State or Federal
		Government - have the authority to undertake the proposed grant
		activities - have an organisational structure that does not allow for
		the distribution of profit or personal gain during operation and/or in
		the event of wind up.
